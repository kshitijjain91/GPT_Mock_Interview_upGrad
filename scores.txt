, 

to build a linear regression model in the example of predicting the price of a house, i would first need to gather data on past house sales. this data would include information on the location, size, age, and other features of the houses sold. i would then need to split this data into a training set and a test set. 

to train the model, i would use the training set to create a linear regression model that predicts the sale price of a house based on its features. i would then test this model on the test set to see how accurate it is. 

to improve the accuracy of the model, i would try different methods of preprocessing the data, such as normalizing the data or adding polynomial features. i would also try different algorithms, such as ridge regression or lasso regression.

to check for the lack of correlation between input variables, i would look at the correlation matrix. this will tell me whether or not there is a linear relationship between any of the input variables. if there is a linear relationship, then i would expect to see a high correlation between those variables.
