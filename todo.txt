- Find speech to text API
- Deploy app on Hugging face space, integrate with Cloud DBs?
- Raise exception if openAI error [APIConnectionError]; raise gradio error
- Modularize instructions and create one for DM


- Provide common interview questions to GPT and guide GPT to ask questions in a representative flow; 
create rubric for each question so grading quality is better

- Improve grading and feedback prompts
	- Provide hints if unsure e.g. Hint: Think about things like normality, homoscedasticity, independence, and absence of multicollinearity. 
	- If response is imperfect, probe deeper on the same topic
	- Add examples to rubrics
	- Question - response pair is not exhaustive!
	- Grade is too harsh! Modify this.
	- Test reliability: Should be 10/10 for perfect reponses; less than 4/10 for bad responses

- Create UI on gradio
	- Add progress bar / some way to tell user how much interview is left
	- Hint functionality
	- P2 stuff:
		- Add flags 
		- Set difficulty level

## Macro (Long Term) Todo 
- Create plan for adoption and scale/impact (align with VG) 
- Build long term product plan: Ideally all data should be stored in a DB so we can fine tune the model continuously
- Consult someone from tech on this: Where should this be deployed, which DBs, should we launch on gradio and meanwhile build elsewhere etc
